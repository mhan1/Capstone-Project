"Note: This table counts a single dentist toward each practice area for which they hold a degree. For example, a dentist possessing degrees in orthodontics and pediatric dentistry will be counted in both categories. Therefore, the sum of categories will exceed the number of dentists working in dentistry. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
